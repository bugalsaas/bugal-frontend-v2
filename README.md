# Bugal Frontend V2

## Overview
Bugal Frontend V2 is a complete modernization of the Bugal business management platform, migrating from Ant Design + React 16 to a modern Next.js 15 + React 19 + Tailwind CSS 4 + Radix UI stack.

## üéØ Project Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Modern Technology Stack**: Migrate from legacy React 16 + Ant Design to Next.js 15 + React 19 + Tailwind CSS 4
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimize for mobile users with 44px minimum touch targets and responsive layouts
- **Zero Backend Changes**: Frontend-only migration - no backend modifications required
- **Feature Parity**: Maintain exact same functionality as the legacy frontend
- **Performance Improvement**: Faster builds, better mobile performance, modern React patterns
- **Parallel Deployment**: Deploy alongside old frontend with user toggle capability for safe migration
- **Risk Mitigation**: Users can switch back to old frontend if issues arise

### Business Management Platform
Bugal serves as a comprehensive business management platform with these core modules:
- **Dashboard**: Overview with stats, quick actions, and recent activity
- **Contacts**: Customer/client management system
- **Shifts**: Work scheduling and time tracking
- **Invoices**: Billing and payment management
- **Reports**: Analytics and business insights
- **Organizations**: Multi-tenant organization management
- **Users**: User management and permissions
- **Expenses**: Expense tracking and management
- **Incidents**: Incident reporting and management
- **Rates**: Rate/pricing management
- **Agreements**: Contract and agreement management
- **Subscriptions**: Subscription and billing management

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **React**: React 19 with modern hooks and patterns
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 with mobile-first approach
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives + shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (server state) + Zustand (client state)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout

### Key Principles
- **Mobile-First**: Design for mobile, enhance for desktop
- **Component-Driven**: Atomic design principles with reusable components
- **API Compatibility**: 100% compatibility with existing backend APIs
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only essential libraries to reduce bundle size
- **Backend Preservation**: Zero backend changes - frontend-only migration

## üì± Mobile-First Design System

### Design Tokens
- **Colors**: Bugal brand palette (primary blue, success green, warning orange, destructive red)
- **Typography**: Geist font family for modern, clean appearance
- **Spacing**: Mobile-first spacing scale (4px base unit)
- **Breakpoints**: sm: 640px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px, xl: 1280px
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for mobile accessibility

### Layout Patterns
- **Mobile**: Bottom navigation, card layouts, full-screen modals
- **Desktop**: Sidebar navigation, table layouts, centered modals
- **Responsive**: Progressive enhancement from mobile to desktop

## üîå API Integration

### Shared API Layer
All API services are located in `/shared/api/` to ensure:
- Single source of truth for API logic
- Identical API calls between old and new frontend
- Zero backend changes required
- Easy maintenance and bug fixes

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Protected routes for authenticated users
- Organization context for multi-tenant support

## üöÄ Development Process

### Migration Strategy
1. **Reference Screenshots**: Use `/docs/screenshots/` as visual reference for each page/modal
2. **Rebuild with New Stack**: Recreate using Next.js + Tailwind + Radix UI
3. **Wire to Backend**: Connect to existing API endpoints (no backend changes)
4. **Reference Legacy Code**: Check old Ant Design code for backend connections
5. **Maintain Functionality**: Ensure identical behavior to legacy frontend

### Feature Migration Order
1. **Dashboard** (most-used feature)
2. **Shifts** management
3. **Contacts** management
4. **Invoices** management
5. **Reports** section
6. Secondary features (Agreements, Expenses, Rates, etc.)
